ü©∫ End-to-End Medical Chatbot using LLaMA2, LangChain, HuggingFace & Pinecone
This project is an AI-powered medical chatbot built using LangChain, LLaMA2 (via CTransformers), HuggingFace sentence embeddings, and Pinecone vector store. It enables users to ask medical-related queries, and provides context-aware, relevant answers by retrieving information from PDF-based medical documents.
